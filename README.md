 10. Verify contact info is correct.

# Copy Formatting
 The default formatting is as follows:
 ----------------------------
 FirstName LastName
 Contact Title
 Address
 City, Province PostalCode

 Dear Salutation LastName,
 ----------------------------
 You can customize this by modifying the format in popup.js if desired.

 Note: This is a roughly made extension that might not work all the time but that's good enough for me so it better be good enough for you.
